    VeinNet is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based hand vein recognition system. The system is designed to recognize the unique vein patterns in the human hand. The system is trained on a dataset of hand vein images and is able to recognize the vein patterns in a given image. The system is implemented using the PyTorch deep learning framework and is trained on a GPU for faster training times. The system achieves an accuracy of 90\% on the test dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of the CNN-based approach for hand vein recognition.
